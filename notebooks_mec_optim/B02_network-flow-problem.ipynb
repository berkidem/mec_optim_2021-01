    "This problem belongs to the class of *min-cost flow problems*, an important class of linear programming problems, which are the focus of today's lecture. A decade before the invention of linear programming and the work of Kantorovich, Koopmans and Dantzig, Tolstoi described a heuristic method for solving the problem, which led to the optimal solution. As one can recover using modern tools, and will see that his solution was right.\n",
